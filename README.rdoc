= Rangify

This gem will add the rangify method to Ruby's Array class.
The rangify method will produce appropriate ranges from the objects in the array.

= Usage

Examples:

[1,2,3,6,7,8].rangify = [1..3, 6..8]

[10..15, 16..20, 21, 22].rangify = [10..22]


Assumes inclusive ranges (ie. 1..4) and range.first <= range.last.

Works with integers, dates and strings.  However, all the objects in the array must be of the same class.
